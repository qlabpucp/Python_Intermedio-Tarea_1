I hope the mirror is still in tact when they come across it. It wasn’t just Trump’s insanity, or Mitch and the 2000 checks, or the insanity of the GOP... it was the casual conservative member allowing themselves to be seduced by false prophets. It was the collective disgust of everyone around these conservatives that has propelled the success of Stacey Abrams and the New Democratic Party.

5su9ig,"So, since this post came up, the official PotUS Twitter has retweeted the Nordstrom complaint",1959
5su9ig,"Legally, it's not technically an issue. Is it an ethical concern? Absolutely. Having the president publicly criticizing corporations and individuals for their dealings with members of his family or his private businesses is a serious ethical issue that can have real-world ramifications for anyone the president targets with his ire. The fact that he hasn't divested his private business interests is also an ethical issue that compounds the first issue.

In this case, I'm not sure that Donald Trump understands ethics in government as a concept, much less business ethics. That explains why we continue to see this behavior.

Will he suffer any tangible consequences for it? I doubt it. He hasn't suffered any so far, and this has been an issue for months even before the inauguration. The Republican-controlled Congress doesn't seem to care about what Trump does, as long as he continues to help them push their agenda forward and maintains the (R) next to his name.

This is all to say nothing of the cognitive dissonance required for Donald Trump to criticize Nordstrom for not doing business with his daughter, when just a few months ago he was talking about how using tax loopholes to minimize his businesses owed taxes **isn't** unfair it just ""makes (him) smart"".

5txzyf,"The Trump team has about 8 hours to come up with a DAMN good response to the question: ""What did the President know about Flynn's dealings with Russia."" 

There really is no other precedent, and the issue will be hard to spin. Most importantly, this reaffirms fears that congressional Republicans had with Trump. Out of anything that has happened thus far, this will strain Trump's relationship with Congress the most. 

This type of scenario needs nuanced communications and deep legal understanding, neither of which are this administration's strong suit. If Trump defends Flynn, who apparently is strongly liked by the President and Bannon, it will be the creation of a huge political scandal.

5txzyf,"The Russia story is going to explode again. This is going to be a media frenzy. In response, the Trump admin is going to try to pin the entire Russia story on Flynn and wrap it up in a nice little package, but that probably won't work. 

Questions remaining: Why was Conway so sure of Trump's total confidence in Flynn? Was she out of the loop? Was she lying? Something to keep track of.

Wasn't Flynn one of the possible choices for VP? I think this new info puts that in a new light. 

Trump's approval ratings will sink lower. I think we could see calls for investigations into Flynn or even wider investigations from Republicans nervous about reelection. 

Most importantly: What did Trump know, and when? Was Trump aware of Flynn's call before the call was made? 

Note how it's always been a major point that Pence was not aware and was lied to. That could be a very important point soon. 


EDIT Tuesday AM: Kellyanne Conway is on the news this morning making it sound like the reason Flynn had to go was that he lied to Pence. This makes no sense because they've known for at least two weeks that he lied to Pence. 

Yates was fired immediately for insubordination, but Flynn stayed on for two weeks with the full confidence of the president? And it was Flynn's decision alone to resign? 

This all makes it sound very much like Flynn was not acting alone. Pence's role in all of this makes perfect sense if you look at it from the perspective that he's setting himself up to come out of this unscathed if it takes down Trump. 

EDIT Tuesday late AM: Republican Senator Roy Blunt is calling for an investigation into Trump's ties with Russia. Chaffetz says he's not investigating. Chaffetz should be investigated

EDIT Tuesday PM: Where's Reince Priebus?

EDIT Tuesday late PM: Spicer says Flynn was asked to resign. Yet another detail where Conway was out of the loop, or lying. Why does anyone have Conway on their show?

Trump was briefed about Flynn on Jan 26, almost three weeks ago. And now they've come up with the ""erosion of trust"" line. Smells like BS to me. The political situation became untenable, so he had to go. 

We need to know what Mike Pence knew, and when. Sounds like a good chance that Mike Pence lied to the country about Flynn's call. 

Steve Bannon is looking mighty lonely on the National Security Council. 

",1117
5txzyf,"Where exactly they go from here is a big question. In the short term, there's some likely fallout:

>It reignites the accusations of Trump being too close to Russia. The intelligence community was already getting skittish, but this marks the second of Trump's inner circle advisors (the first being Paul Mannafort on the campaign trail) who have gotten the axe for issues stemming over their ties to Russia.

>It's a problem for Trump's stance of being 'tough on national security' since his advisor was just forced to resign in less than a month, on top of the NSC shakeups in the news a few weeks ago.

>In a shaky administration, it means that there's likely going to be even more turbulence on their national security team(s) as a new advisor has to be quickly chosen and pick up where Flynn left off, absent the opportunity to slowly ease into the role and prepare for a smooth transition.

Defensively, the Trump team only really has two defensive options they can go for, politically speaking:

First, they can claim that Flynn's resignation was on account of his misinformation to Pence and other officials. Secondly, since the actual transcript is very bad, they can use that first defense to downplay what he was saying in the Russian conversation. ""While the former advisor did have contact with Russian diplomats prior to coming into the White House, those conversations are normal for incoming people in sensitive positions. Flynn's resignation was not the result of any promises of sanction easing for Russia as his conversation with the ambassador did not cover that topic. He has resigned due to his failure to properly communicate with other officials within the administration."" Something like that.

That's really their only serious face saving option, and most everything else will play a part of throwing Flynn under the bus. This being the Trump administration though, we're likely to see the above defense more crudely worded, along with admonishments from Twitting Trump and Spicer that the media is ""unfairly"" blowing the scandal up. They will also use Flynn's lying as an excuse to protect the president's image of picking ""the right guy for the job.""",203

5n8tv6,"So I've read the entire report, which can be read here.

https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.html

Here is a summary of the claims.  **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**:  I don't want to be spreading fake news so I want to emphasize that none of these have been proven.  THis is also not an intelligence report from a government agency, this was complied by a private intelligence company.  In the comment below posted some excellent reasons why we should be skeptical.  So reader beware.

But they're worth summarizing  because if they are true, they are big.

Here is my summary of, in my opinion, the most important claims:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**pg 4)** Trump used tons of prostitutes, in one case, to defile a bed Obama and his wife slept in with urine.

**Pg 7)**  Russia was, in fact, behind the DNC hack.  Trump knew about Russian efforts to hack the DNC and release damaging information and as a quid pro quo dropped Ukraine as a campaign issue and raised issues with NATO. This wasn't a passive reaction but was planned and conducted with the full knowledge and approval of the Trump team. 

**pg 8)**  Trump's team *wanted* Russia to a campaign issue because it deflected attention away from Trump's businuess dealings in China, which involved ""extensive"" bribes.

**Pg 11)**  Trump has been in close contact with Russian intel for almost a decade.  Trump and people close to him apparently supplied information to Russia intelligence regarding Russian oligarchs living in the US for years.  

**pg 18)**  Apparently Trump's lawyer, this Cohen guy, was meeting with various Russian officials in Prague.  This was to discuss the fallout from the Manafort scandal.  Also, Carter Page, Trump's foreign relation's advisor, met with Russian officials. (EDITED: got Cohen and Page mixed up).

Throughout the second third of the report (pg 20 onward), it is said Putin and Russian intelligence feared blowback from their release of e-mails and were disappointed the e-mail release didn't have as big an impact as they hoped for.  Apparently, around October, even Russian intelligence stopped believing in Trump.

**Pg 30)**  Carter Page apparently told Russian officials that Trump would lift sanctions if elected president.

**pg 32-34)**  Cohen was apparently heavily involved in efforts to cover up Trump's contacts with Russia, particularly Carter Page's meeting with Russian officials.  Cohen also met with Russian officials to plan out how to cover up payments to Russian operators and cover their tracks if Clinton were to become president.

**pg 35)**  Very interesting sentence.  It states that Russian hackers were paid by both Russian **and** Trump's team but were ultimately loyal to Russia.  
",406
5n8tv6,"CNN is staking their reputation on this story. If it's true, than this is huge. This could be impeachment level big, but who knows? Most Trump lovers will probably just shrug this off and say ""at least he's not Clinton.""",1167

The use of such language - and implication the government officials should be loyal to the President, and not The Constitution - is yet another sign we are on the road to fascism. 

Trump seems set to purge anyone who will not allow him absolute unchecked authority from government. Yates will likely be the first of many purges from every branch of government. As soon as Trump gets any evidence of Graham or McCain communicating with The Ukrainian Government he will probably have them arrested for violating The Hatch Act.

Remember, Donald Trump promised to have a deportation force to remove over 10 million undocumented immigrants, promised to punish women who get abortions, promised to bomb the innocent families of terrorists (Geneva Convention violation), recently threatened to ""send the Feds"" to Chicago if violence does not stop, his VP is openly and strongly anti-LGBTQ, he placed his white supremacist toady Bannon to a permanent position in the NSC and revoked the CJCS and DNI permanent seats. This is just a small sample.

What happens when American citizens, that may physically look like undocumented immigrants, get caught in a deportation raid? What happens when the American military murders innocent civilians? What happens when the Feds he threatened to send to Chicago kill innocent American citizens?

Where's the line here?",797

The circumstances are different, but in both cases the Attorney General had to leave because they refused to cooperate with what they believed was an illegal order.  

My question is, what consequences can we expect from this?

df98y3,"To answer some of the questions in OP's bullet points, it's not the President who determines what impeachment means or to flesh out the finer details of how it works. 

Impeachment is a power granted by the Constitution and by law to Congress. Remember, the division of power is that Congress makes the laws, the Executive branch enforces the laws, and the Judicial branch (the Courts) say what the law means. Importantly, even with all of the expansion of power in recent years through executive orders, the President doesn't really get to say what the law means. That's out of his or her lane.

So a few scenarios: 

What should happen is that Congress exercises their power to subpoena and then starts holding people in contempt, arresting them and putting them in jail. That should cause more reasonable minds to prevail. 

If not, the next step is a constitutional challenge that will go to the Courts. Even with the conservative judge packing that's gone on, the Courts should side with Congress when something is as black and white as impeachment powers. 

At that point, if the Executive branch digs in and refuses to blink, and Republican Senators also refuse to flip on Trump, then we probably have one of if not the most serious constitutional crisis we've ever experienced. We're in a dooms day scenario at that point where the co-equal branches of government have ceased to respect each other's powers, and our system of government quickly unravels. 

I would like to think that we won't get to that point, and two of the three bodies of power would gang up to stop a full blown constitutional crisis before we literally destroy our system of government.

5hhn4t,"So this story is obviously blowing up. Here's a summary of what has been going down with Russia, U.S. intelligence, and the hacked DNC emails, and why this CIA assessment is important:

* **May '16**: DNC learned that [hackers had breached their servers](http://time.com/4368534/dnc-democratic-national-committee-hack-russia-donald-trump/) and hired cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike to investigate. 

* **June**: [CrowdStrike identified two adversaries](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/) - Cozy Bear/Fancy Bear (aka APT 28/APT 29) - that are ""Russian-intelligence"" affiliated. Other firms like [SecureWorks](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-4127-targets-hillary-clinton-presidential-campaign) have independently corroborated CrowdStrike's attribution with ""moderate confidence"". Cybersecurity consultant Jeffrey Carr [disputed the strength of their evidence](https://medium.com/@jeffreycarr/can-facts-slow-the-dnc-breach-runaway-train-lets-try-14040ac68a55#.tioemmsxx).

* **June**: [Guccifer 2.0](https://guccifer2.wordpress.com), claiming to be a lone Romanian hacker, took credit and [leaked certain alleged DNC documents](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/dnc-hacker-leaks-trump-oppo-report-647293) to media outlets. Researchers like [ThreatConnect](https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/guccifer-2-all-roads-lead-russia/) and investigators have tied Guccifer 2.0 to Russia and believe it is a group [acting for Russian intelligence](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/07/27/us/politics/trail-of-dnc-emails-russia-hacking.html). 

* **June 22nd**: Wikileaks released 20,000 DNC emails. Guccifer 2.0 claimed he is [WL's source](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/guccifer-2-claims-responsibility-for-dnc-email-dump). [Assange invoked source-protection](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/wikileaks-julian-assange-no-proof-hacked-dnc-emails-came-russia-n616541), but later denied [the Russian gov as WL's source](http://johnpilger.com/articles/the-secrets-of-the-us-election-julian-assange-talks-to-john-pilger).

* **July**: US intelligence, including the FBI, appeared to have [reached a consensus, though not unanimous, that the Russian govt was involved in the hacks](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/politics/spy-agency-consensus-grows-that-russia-hacked-dnc.html?ref=topics). However, cybersecurity experts were [divided over Russia's motivations](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jul/31/what-we-know-about-russias-role-dnc-email-leak/). Intelligence officials and Pres. Obama did not publicly accuse Russia of trying to influence the election results. 

* **September**: according to [WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?tid=sm_tw&utm_term=.353252cc8856), Obama sent counterterrorism advisor Monaco, FBI head Comey, and DHS Secretary Johsnson to lay out evidence of Russian cyber-intrusions in two states and the DNC/Podesta hacks to a Gang of 12, seeking ""a show of bipartisan support"" against ""unprecedented"" foreign influence in the election. Ds were unanimously in support, Rs were divided. (Gang of 12 is likely: Pelosi, Reid, Ryan, McConnell, Nunes, Burr, Feinstein, Schiff, McCaul, Thompson, Johnson, and Carper).

* **October 7**: the [Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint statement](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national) assessing it would be difficult for a single actor to alter election results and implicated Moscow in the email hacks:
> The U.S. Intelligence Community [includes 16 agencies] is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations...intended to interfere with the US election process...based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts...only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. The [White House followed-up](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/11/press-gaggle-press-secretary-josh-earnest-en-route-greensboro-nc) on 10/11 that the response to Russia would be ""proportional"".

* **October 30th**: Sen. Harry Reid [accused Comey] (http://www.reid.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Letter-to-Director-Comey-10_30_2016.pdf) of withholding ""explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government"" from the public in a demonstration of a ""double standard"" with regards to sensitive information. 

* **October 31**:  A [former FBI official told CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/31/fbis-comey-opposed-naming-russians-citing-election-timing-source.html) that ""Comey agreed that...A foreign power was trying to undermine the election...but was against putting it out before the election."" [Mother Jones](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/veteran-spy-gave-fbi-info-alleging-russian-operation-cultivate-donald-trump) cites evidence from an ex-spy connecting Trump's campaign and advisors to the Russian gov. [FBI officials spoke anonymously to the NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html?mtrref=undefined) stating that none of the investigations into Trump and his advisors hadn't ""found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government"" and that based on investigations into the hack, they were ""increasingly confident"" that:
> Russia’s direct goal is not to support the election of Mr. Trump, as many Democrats have asserted, but rather to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine America’s standing in the world more broadly. (ETA)
 
* **December 9**: Obama [ordered intelligence officials](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/12/09/press-briefing-principal-deputy-press-secretary-eric-schultz-12916) to conduct a ""deep dive"" review of election-season cyber-attacks, including the email hacks, to report before he leaves office on January 20th. This report may not be disclosed to the public.  

* Anonymous officials disclosed to WaPo that the CIA's latest briefing to key senators made it [""quite clear"" [with high confidence] that Russia's goal in intervening in the election was to help Donald Trump win](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?tid=sm_tw&utm_term=.353252cc8856). However, according to one senior U.S. official, ""there were *minor disagreements* among intelligence officials about the agency’s assessment"" and ""the hackers were 'one step' removed from the Russian government."" However, Moscow has previously conducted espionage using middlemen. An FBI official before the House Intelligence Committee [did not concur with the CIA assessment re: Russia's intent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-and-cia-give-differing-accounts-to-lawmakers-on-russias-motives-in-2016-hacks/2016/12/10/c6dfadfa-bef0-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?utm_term=.9e05646fc5c2). Additionally, an official familiar with the latest CIA assessment said it does not mean that ""Moscow’s efforts altered or significantly affected the outcome of the election."" 

* [The NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/us/obama-russia-election-hack.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news) reported that intelligence officials found that Russia had, *in the spring*, successfully: 
> hacked the Republican National Committee’s computer systems in addition to their attacks on Democratic organizations, but did not release whatever information they gleaned from the Republican networks.
CIA and NSA officials have also identified *individual Russian state officials* they believe to be responsible for the hacks. 

The WaPo report is groundbreaking because it reveals intelligence officials believe Russia's motivation was to get Trump elected over Clinton. What evidence available is still unclear, but likely both [forensic and other intelligence](https://www.c-span.org/video/?418617-1/james-clapper-testifies-capitol-hill-submitting-resignation&start=2503). Neither WaPo/NYT provided documentation underlying officials' assertions, but senators on the intelligence committee [have requested Obama ""release to the public""](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/download/?id=D12DD589-5800-4BEF-9F93-A0A122F38D29&download=1) info on the Russian gov and U.S. election. [Glenn Greenwald makes the case](https://theintercept.com/2016/12/10/anonymous-leaks-to-the-washpost-about-the-cias-russia-beliefs-are-no-substitute-for-evidence/) for why the public should be skeptical of the recent WaPo/NYT reports due to the opacity of agency motivations and lack of public evidence. 

Trump's team [denies Russian interference in the election](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/10/politics/donald-trump-response-russian-hacking/) and direct contact with Moscow. [Russia's deputy foreign minister](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/world/europe/trump-campaign-russia.html) has claimed that Russian reps have maintained contact with prominent Trump supporters, though it is not clear if that claim included campaign staff. 

Notably, the FBI found Russian or Chinese hackers [stole files from the Obama and McCain campaigns in 2008](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2008/nov/07/obama-white-house-usa), but did not tie them to any foreign government.

5hhn4t,">Will this have any tangible effect with the electoral college or the next 4 years?

I suspect this is going to depend both on what findings come to light in the next month and how much public pressure there is. If it's verified that Russia had a significant enough effect on the election, electors will face an incredibly difficult decision in whether to honor a tainted election or become faithless and swing the election. If there's sufficient public pressure on electors and politicians, I could also see them being pressured to either change their vote or not vote at all, perhaps leading to a <270 pledged elector total for Trump, insufficient to win. 

Longer-term, we've had two elections in just the last few years that have had the popular vote overridden by the electoral vote, and a particularly divisive and unpopular president-elect, which means we're in a better position politically to rally the public to pressure Congress about the Electoral College. If this can gain unusually and perhaps unlikely high support, the Amendment process could be an option. 

>Would this have changed the election results if it were released during the GE?

Almost certainly. The repeated investigations of Clinton have been said by analysts to have had a significant consequence on Clinton's public image, in particular her trustworthiness. When Comey made his now infamous letter public, right before the general election, Clinton's polling numbers swung radically. 

__________________________

I'm not sure why this wasn't asked, but I think the real question is this: ***If the US election was sufficiently tampered with by an outside power, what legal or political mechanisms are in place to halt the process, and should they be used?*** The electoral college is one avenue, but I don't think it's the only one. Congress accepts the electoral college votes and has the opportunity to challenge via petition if I remember my political science classes correctly. The challenge would trigger a vote which could nullify electoral votes. After the election, if Trump was found to collude with Russia, that would likely be a violation of US law and an impeachable offense. 

What to take away from all of this? If it turns out Russia sufficiently tampered with the US presidential election, **the most important thing will be public pressure**. That's how things in the US get done. We need **coalition-building**. We need to make this about the US vs. Russia, not about the left vs. right or Democrats vs. Republicans, because that will stall any efforts to have a fair election and we run the risk of having a puppet government.

The White House then said they wanted to determine if they were going to enact ""Executive Privilege"" (which doesn't count in the case of a crime anyway), and that the DOJ felt that they had a technicality in the Whistleblower Act language (ie, whether or not this was urgent concern), this was almost swept under the rug.  By Maguire's own admission, the only reason we're even talking about it today is because the media effectively forced Trump to release the transcripts thereby causing the House to declare an Impeachment Inquiry, thus apparently alleviating the executive privilege from being a possibility, and enabling Maguire to declassify the report.

My personal questions/observations here I'm curious if others here will agree or disagree with:

1. What would've happened if the media never gotten any reports (ie, ""leaks"" as the GOP is calling them) that this Whistle-blower report even existed?  Do we think this would have eventually gotten to Congress (even if in private)?
2. How can this possibly be the way the law is written?  If it is, how can it be changed to not allow this in the future?  Congress, by right and authority, oversees these matters -- how can that be guaranteed in the future?

d9ldtg,"The whitleblower seems to believe themselves that the military aid was withheld in order to get Ukraine to 'play ball' on the Biden investigation. This is based on their understanding that calls and meetings between Ukraine's president and Trump had been held under this condition, and that the direction to withhold the funding came from Trump himself.   


The attempt at a cover-up (whether the specific action of classifying the document is legal or not) is a bad look, because they clearly knew that something bad was afoot.   


I think the whistleblower's description of the events leading up to the call where Giuliani had been in contact with Ukranian officials many times further illustrates how the transcript of the message itself is just one piece of a larger puzzle that congress should certainly use its impeachment investigatory powers to look more into.

[Remember how the Constitution Party has raised 30 grand in all of 2016?](http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00279802/1072983/#SUMMARY) You can't campaign downballot without funding. This is how the Hillary Victory Fund works (ostensibly) - what Hillary doesn't need, or what the DNC gets, goes to downballot Democrats. Libertarians do the same thing since promoting Johnson promotes the party.

4t77xf,"I'm very conflicted about this.

Yes, it's suspect that she was once slated for DNC keynote slot, but I've also heard rumors that her keynote status was unofficial and unconfirmed.

Now she's no longer an unofficial keynote speaker. Apparently, John Edwards was briefly supposed to be keynote speaker, but they took him off so Kerry could tap him as VP.

*However*, it is important to look at who else joined Warren during her recent meeting with Clinton. Apparently it was Hickenlooper and Castro as well. Imo, this was Clinton's way of politely telling her VP contenders that she would be picking Kaine over them. That's what I think, else why wouldn't Kaine be there? He probably was off tying up loose ends before he transitioned to being VP candidate.

But at the same time, why was Hickenlooper in that meeting as well? He was never a serious contender, not on any shortlist. Plus, why was Castro there? I feel as if he was largely dismissed long ago, to the point where Clinton would have notified him a while ago that she would most likely not choose him.",444

As for the pros, Warren would obviously excite a lot of progressives and would inject some serious energy into the Clinton campaign. 



Cons of course are that she's being taken out of the Senate, and that it could actually turn some moderates off from voting Clinton. My father, for example, is a moderate Republican who is leaning towards voting Democrat for the first time in his life. But he can't stand candidates as progressive as Warren, and would only be voting for Clinton because he hates Trump. I'm willing to bet there are a lot of moderates out there who would be far less happy about Warren's nomination as VP, whereas if Clinton picked a moderate VP they might be more open to switching party allegiances for this election. So I don't know. I'd be curious to see how Warren polls as compared to the other candidates though.",27

He has unethically benefited from a business standpoint by having the government spend millions at his hotels. 

He has refused to demonstrate sympathy when a tragic shooting occurs.

He has mocked gold star families.

He goes on tirades on Twitter.

He fabricates ""facts"" (like the ones related to the Queen) to make himself seem better.

He had a scandal with a porn star.

He constantly attacks the Constitution of Free Speech by calling various journalism ""Fake News"".

7erver,"I have hesitated talking about certain past life experiences for the sake of just not putting any sort of spot light but you know what, fuck it, this is important. I've lived in places in the middle east where the internet was not free and open. Where access was granted and denied at the whim of other people and you know what? It's fucking awful.

Now, the scope of what I am talking about is in many ways different from what the FCC is talking about here. It's not nearly as bad, however, I feel like there are some relevant crossovers to mention.

First of all, since there were no laws or policies in place to protect the customer, internet companies could basically do whatever the hell they wanted. Do you know why? Because they are basically owned by the state they operate in. 68% of Ooredoo is owned by the state of Qatar, Etisalat; the 14th largest mobile network operator in the world 60% of it owned by the UAE. So here is some shit they can pull. And this isn't just a problem in the middle eastern gulf, this happens in all kinds of places in the middle east that do not necessarily practise censorship.

First of all, they absolutely throttle your access to certain online services. For example, teamspeak. This is such a thing in certain countries it is hilarious. Teamspeak is a VOIP application for gamers yet for whatever reason, there are certain places where you just cannot use it. You will find yourself being throttled for the seemingly most random things and you will never know why. This is literally the kind of thing net neutrality protects us all from. Your ISP doesn't like the fact that a lot of people are using discord or netflix for example? Throttle the shit out of it or charge a shit ton of money. Oh this is the best one. ETISALAT LITERALLY BLOCKS MESSENGER, VIBER AND ALL OTHER VOIP SERVICES. Why? So that people can only use their own mobile network to call overseas. It is literally the most annoying thing ever. I cannot call my family in the UAE on messenger or any of those services because it is literally blocked so that they have to pay money to call on the regular phone network. What is to stop companies like Verizon or Comcast from doing this??

Censorship. Now yes, nothing about this FCC decision will come into the realm of censorship eh? But how can you be so sure? The fact that companies like ooreedoo and etisilat are primarily owned by the state, means that they have blocked all immoral content; porn websites, hell even things that aren't even porn but have someone dressed in a lewd manner. They have blocked any site that critiques their governments, sexual health resources for pete's sake, dating services etc.

Will there ever come a day where now that net neutrality has been done away with where partisan congress members can push for the restriction of sexual health services for example because it goes against their ideals? I mean what is to say that there won't be any collusion between government representatives and internet providers over the semantics of what is subject to heavier prices, access or restrictions?

This is of course assuming the worst, but we cannot pretend that people will not try to use this to their advantage. Not to mention that this pigeon holes people's free access to so many things. Let's say I am writing a paper for school and reach my limit for a certain database, website or whatever it may be. Then what? Am I supposed to move on to more sanctioned resources that I will have longer access to? Why? Why can't I just use what I want. What if I am an alcoholic and I come to reddit everyday because I am part of a support community. What will happen once I cannot come back here to talk to my community and I cannot afford to ""unlock reddit"".

I try my best to see any redeeming qualities of doing away with net neutrality but I have already experienced the very bare minimum of it minus the censorship and it actually fucking sucks.

I am so thankful and privileged to have become a Canadian and to now be living in Canada. Sometimes we cannot really visualise just exactly how good we have it until we experience it about 1000 times worse.

fbvzuo,"""A conservation group has closed a $15.65 million deal to buy the largest privately owned giant sequoia grove left on Earth, an ancient forest with hundreds of the endangered redwood trees, which can live for 3,000 years and rise nearly as tall as the Statue of Liberty. Due to its size, health and age diversity — with sequoias ranging from seedlings to Methuselahs — this grove represents ""the most consequential giant sequoia conservation project of our lifetime,"" according to the group's president.

Known as Alder Creek, the grove covers a seemingly modest 530 acres (2 square kilometers), but that's a big deal for giant sequoias.

This particular grove packs a lot into its 530 acres, including 483 sequoias with trunks at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter, along with a few hundred smaller sequoias of varying ages.

That age range is a big reason why this grove is so valuable, according to Sam Hodder, president and CEO of Save the Redwoods League (SRL), a century-old California nonprofit that's been working to acquire Alder Creek for more than 20 years.

**""Many giant sequoia groves are just a single age class, usually in the thousands,"" Hodder told MNN when the deal was announced in September 2019. ""In this one, a real indication of its health and resilience is that there are giant sequoia of all age ranges."" While any remaining giant sequoia grove is a rarity, he adds, ""it's rarer still to have multiple age classes, and such a healthy forest ecosystem.""**

SRL signed a purchase agreement with the Rouch family, which has owned the grove since the 1940s. That was a big step after two decades, but the sale wasn't official — until now. There was the small matter of $15.65 million, which SRL had to raise by Dec. 31 before it could take ownership. The group did that with a public fundraising drive on its website that rallied for help right up to the deadline. Donations rolled in from more than 8,500 donors from all 50 states and around the world.


Alder Creek is an island of private property surrounded by Giant Sequoia National Monument, which spans about 328,000 acres (1,327 square km) and connects to the even larger Sequoia National Forest. The Rouch family has long used the grove for commercial logging, Hodder says, and even cut down giant sequoias in the early days, although since the 1960s they've reportedly only logged non-sequoia species like sugar pine and white fir. SRL plans to eventually transfer ownership to the U.S. Forest Service, so the sequoias can join the federally protected wilderness around them.

That won't happen for a while, though, since SRL expects to hold the property for five to 10 years. That's partly because this kind of public-acquisition process moves slowly, Hodder says, but also because SRL wants time to study the grove and implement a plan for good stewardship, making sure the trees are healthy and ready before handing them over to the public.

As part of that preparation, the group plans to open Alder Creek for public access even before giving it to the Forest Service, hoping to help the ecosystem ease into an unfamiliar role as a host for human visitors. ""This property has been in private ownership, and it has never had public access,"" Hodder says. ""We want to go through a thoughtful process to plan out public access, so when it does get conveyed into the national monument, it's ready for its public purpose."""" - article excerpt",3136

When I saw the Statue of Liberty for the first time *my very first thought* was, ""this thing is a lot smaller than I thought it would be.""  

I dunno. That's just my two pennies.",497
